Hey C Hartley, lets see if you can open this in obsidian.

Answer - I sure can!

So, some first ideas:

- If we are going to each tackle a different thing first, then I think one person should work on a [[Card Object]], and the other should work on [[Array Logic]]. When we have progress on both, maybe we can start putting them both together. I don't know how to make different module files yet, but that's probably the move here to import Card objects into Array logic.
